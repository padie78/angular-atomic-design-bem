## 📐 Project Architecture

The codebase is organized based on Atomic Design:

- **Atoms** – Reusable basic components like buttons, inputs, icons.
- **Molecules** – Small combinations of atoms (e.g., search bars, cards).
- **Organisms** – More complex combinations (e.g., navbars, forms).
- **Templates** – Structural layout without specific data.
- **Pages** – Full views rendered by routes.

All styling follows the **BEM naming convention** to promote maintainable and modular SCSS structure.
